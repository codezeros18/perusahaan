Solar power plants are an exception, as they produce this electricity without the usage of a turbine by using photovoltaic cells.",
    description2 : "A power plant is a set of equipment and machinery used to generate electrical energy through the process of transforming energy from various energy sources. Most types of power plants produce a 3-phase alternating current mains voltage. In addition, most electricity generation uses synchronous generators powered by prime movers who derive energy from fuel or natural resources. The main components in power plants include primary energy installations, start-up installations, cooling installations and electrical installations. The type of power plant is generally named according to the initial driving force used, including water (PLTA), diesel (PLTD), steam (PLTU), gas (PLTG), gas and steam (PLTGU), geothermal (PLTP), and nuclear (NPP).",
